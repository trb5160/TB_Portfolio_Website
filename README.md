Tom Barber Portfolio

Description:  As a prospective web developer, it is necessary to have a central hub of sorts where I can show off my web creations to prospective employers.  This first iteration of my portfolio website has 3 sections, a short about me section, a gallery of my previous works, and contact information.  I choose to sort my previous works as a gallery, as I felt that it would add a bit of style to the website.  I am happy with how it turned out, however I do worry that it is a bit basic.  The colors blue and orange were chosen because they are the colors of my favorite baseball
team, the New York Mets.  As I become more comfortable with html, css, and javascript, I plan to go back and update my portfolio to give it more flair and have it stand out more.
